# My D&D Character Logbook

## Anna Fang | 81850075

Welcome to my CPSC 210 project!

This application is a handy logbook inspired by the roleplay game
*Dungeons & Dragons*, intended to track each character created in a campaign.

Players and Dungeon masters can use this application to add characters to their campaign.
When you add a character, you will be able to enter information about them such as:

- name
- race
- class
- personality
- appearance
- brief backstory

This project is of interest to me because while I absolutely adore
playing D&D with my friends, I am super scatter-brained when it comes
to remembering characters.

D&D is filled with so many fine details and quirks that give the game
its charm. I think the characters people create are the most interesting
part of any campaign, and the character creation is largely what drives
campaign events and the story of the gameplay.
