# My D&D Character Logbook

## Anna Fang | 81850075

Welcome to my CPSC 210 project!

This application is a handy logbook inspired by the roleplay game
*Dungeons & Dragons*, intended to track each character created in a campaign.

Players and Dungeon masters can use this application to add characters to their campaign.
When you add a character, you will be able to enter information about them such as:

- name
- race
- class
- personality
- appearance
- brief backstory

This project is of interest to me because while I absolutely adore
playing D&D with my friends, I am super scatter-brained when it comes
to remembering characters.

D&D is filled with so many fine details and quirks that give the game
its charm. I think the characters people create are the most interesting
part of any campaign, and the character creation is largely what drives
campaign events and the story of the gameplay.

## Instructions for End User
When you are ready to add a character to your campaign, click the 'Add Character' button and enter each field
appropriately. Remember to press ENTER after each prompt so your character data saves!

If you want to save the characters in your campaign, click 'Save Campaign' and you can safely close the application.
The next time you open it, you can view all your saved characters by clicking 'Load Campaign'.

Select a character in the table before clicking 'Remove Character' to remove them. Bye bye!

Edit any attribute of your character in the table by clicking on the cell you want to edit. Remember to press ENTER
to make sure your change registers in the table.

In the top left corner you will see the trust D&D logo! When you open the application this D&D logo also becomes
the application's signature icon on your device's toolbar.
